# Todo.less

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Build

- `yarn build`: generate the production build
- `yarn extension`: generate the development build

## Running on local

- `yarn build` will update the public folder with latest build.
- Go to chrome://extensions/ and select "Load unpacked" option and select the same build folder.
- Everytime you build after this setup, your extension should get updates automatically.
